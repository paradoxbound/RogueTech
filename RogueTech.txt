RogueTech

RogueTech has as goal to provide new challenges and a harsher simgame experience. You have to survive by all means, the enemys will do their best to kill you and no one gives a rats ass about some merc dying

The timeline for this mod is at the start of 4th Succesion and the War of 3039, when the the first technologies of the Helm Core appear around the sphere.

THIS MOD IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE EASY, ENEMIES ARE DEADLIER AND THAT'S INTENTIONAL!

I mean, how fair would it be to just have the player have all these fancy toys?

Highlights

    Big, RogueLike, Sandbox Experience
    Rebalanced Sim and Combat game, to give you a harsher world.
    More Mech's: From the pirate commando with infernos, to the Massive KingCrab-0001 with twin Gaussrifles, face off against all kinds of enemys.
    With the great houses scrambling for superiority and unlocking the secrets of Helm, new weapons arrive on the battlefield, but nothing is cheap.
