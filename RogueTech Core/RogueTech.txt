RogueTech
=========

RogueTech has as goal to provide new challenges and a harsher simgame experience. You have to survive by all means, the enemys will do their best to kill you and no one gives a rats ass about some merc dying

The timeline for this mod is at the start of 4th Succesion and the War of 3039, when the the first technologies of the Helm Core appear around the sphere.

**THIS MOD IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE EASY, ENEMIES ARE DEADLIER AND THAT'S INTENTIONAL!**

I mean, how fair would it be to just have the player have all these fancy toys?

Highlights
----------

    Big, RogueLike, Sandbox Experience
    Rebalanced Sim and Combat game, to give you a harsher world.
    More Mech's: From the pirate commando with infernos, to the Massive KingCrab-0001 with twin Gaussrifles, face off against all kinds of enemys.
    With the great houses scrambling for superiority and unlocking the secrets of Helm, new weapons arrive on the battlefield, but nothing is cheap.


Included Mods
-------------
Check this Article for the mods included in this pack: https://www.nexusmods.com/battletech/articles/27

Required Mods
-------------
MPStark's BattletechModLoader(BTML): https://github.com/Mpstark/BattleTechModLoader/releases

Install
-------
*The All in One, this is the intended game experience. The AIO Package includes most required dll's.*

1. Select your BATTLETECH\Mods\ folder and extract the files
2. Start your game
	
**FIRST START TAKES A WHILE BE PATIENT**

### Optional:
You are also free to poke and prod each of the files to see what you can do.

Update:
-------
To update, simply overwrite existing files.

IF the changelog tells you to do a clean install, delete your mods folder before patching!

IMPORTANT!
----------
If you had other mods installed, and the game doesnt start, delete all saves that uses these as the game may try to reference files from these and can crash on startup.
This is a hbs issue with internal databases on saves, not a RogueTech bug.

Special Thanks
--------------
I want to credit MPStark, Morphyum, RealityMachine and janxious for their dll's, which they have given me permission to be used for this mod pack.

And credit where credit is due, everyone on the battletech discord modders channel, who gave input and who helps ironing out bugs, you are all great guys :)

Thanks to Callyste for the gorgeous Header

Notes
-----
Anyone may take this apart to figure out how modtek works, ill try to add as many different stuff as possible for this purpose. I will also answer about everything i learn and tell you how to use it.
