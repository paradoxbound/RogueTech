RoguetankXL
By Cargo Vroom

Vehicle Improvement Project adapted and expanded for Roguetech.

Units with initialized cv by Cargo, others by Lady A.

2.1.7
 
Gave slightly better loot to a bunch of vehicles even if it was just a non-stock MG.
Gave serious gear to a couple, like the now very accurate Pike and the 'elite' Manticore_dupe
    I think it improves player experience, their reaction to seeing a plus weapon on a tank, 
    even if it's actually just a +Crit Mlaser, is a mix of worry and greed that overcomes any disapointment 
    that the vehicle isn't a pinata they can beat for mech parts.


Installed MG arrays in several vehicles that had 4 or more MG's.
Fixed two Brutus tanks sharing a def,
Fixed Pegasus_RT move speed,
Fixed some bugs in the APC's I changed last time.

Added 80 ton TBM15 carrier,
Added 80 ton TBM10 carrier,
Added 60 ton TBM5 carrier,
Added 60 ton TBM5 and LRM15 hybrid carrier,
Added 60 ton TBM10 and LRM5 hybrid carrier

Added a tracked vehicle movment tweak i forgot to import from VIP into Core.

2.0.0

Complete restructruing. VIP merged with RogueTank. This is now RoguetankXL, the majority of units, and almost all the ones that don't have an individual ingame chassis go here. Roguetank Core contains APCS, variations on vanilla vehicles, and a few carefully selected others.

Corrected armor of Alcorn.
Corrected armor on Demolisher II.
Found Demolisher-R, Shepard, Rottweiler, Kingscorpion to be underweight by TT rules. Corrected trying not to change the spirit of the designs.
Gorgon wasn't TT legal without some involved changes. Found that XL engine allowed something very close to original, it's a medium now.
Harrasser-B overweight. Loadout nerfed to two SSRM4.
Rebuilt Merkava IV and rechristened it "Chariot" because of lore naming conflict and it being to heavy to run with an ICE.

Added two variants of the Fulcrum, an endgame (High BV) hovertank.
Added two variants of Regulator, a medium sniper hovertank.
Added Zephyr (ECM)
Added Scimitar (Narc)
Gave PIKE_RT a TTS like the default VIP version.
Updated all Vehicle ECMs to lootable version: Gear_Guardian_ECM
Updated several units to standardized VIP movedefs,
Linted the jsons; added and removed a bunch of pesky commas.
Removed old unused files.
