Vehicle Improvement Project
By Cargo_Vroom
twitch.tv/cargo_vroom

Battletech has a lot of really cool tanks and other combat vehicles. They are not well represented in the base game.
This mod aims to increase variety and make them more interesting and overall increase their tactical importance.

This mod adds many lore-correct combat vehicles to the game. (Stats taken from Solaris Armor Works and Sarna.net).
This includes everything from flimsy little hovertanks to 100 ton Assault vehicles that can challenge any mech.
They all need to use existing chassis because no one has figured out how to add new models to the game yet.
But effort has been made to match each vehicle with a close visual match from the vanilla options.

Also, it incorporates vehicle AI improvements based on work by LadyAlecko the co-developer of Roguetek. 
They should be less eager to get stepped on now and overall do a better job of providing supporting fire for mechs.

To Install:

A version of this mod is included in Roguetech, if you're playing with that modpack you don't need this.

Requires BTML and Modtek!!!

Place the VehicleImprovementProject folder in your Battletech/mods folder.

Compatibility:

This mod mostly adds things so should be compatible with almost everything.
Other mods that add vehicles may lead to both mod's version of that vehicle appearing.

There may be minor incompatibility with any mod that alters global values for vehicles.
Make sure whichever you want to take precidence is closer to the end of the load order.
