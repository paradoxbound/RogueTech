Vehicle Improvement Project

----------------------------

Battletech has a lot of really cool tanks and other combat vehicles. 
They are not well represented in the base game.
HBS included very few,in the game, and most of them are unusually weak.
This mod aims to increase variety and make them more interesting and overall increase their tactical importance.

This mod adds many lore-correct combat vehicles to the game. (Stats taken from Solaris Armor Works and Sarna.net).
This includes everything from flimsy little hovertanks to 100 ton Assault vehicles that can challenge any mech.

They all need to use existing graphics because adding new art assets to the game is still pretty experimental.
But I've done my best to make the models chosen suggest what sort of vehicle you're dealing with.

Also, it incorporates vehicle AI improvements based on work by LadyAlecko the co-developer of Roguetek. 
They'll be less eager to get stepped on now, and overall do a better job of providing supporting fire for mechs.

---------------------------------

To Install:


Requires BTML and Modtek!!!

Delete old version before upgrading.

Place the VehicleImprovementProject folder in your Battletech/mods folder.
Consult modtek's instructions if you have trouble.

If you want VIP to take precidence over other mods that change vehicles move it to the end of your modtek load order.

(A version of this mod is included in Roguetech. But it's balanced a little differently.
If you want to use this one for the additional features overwrite the files, then move VIP to the bottom of your load order.)

--------------------------------------

Compatibility:

Other mods that add vehicles may lead to both mod's version of that vehicle appearing.

There may be conflicts with other mods that change global values for vehicles like armor multiplier or AI.
Make sure whichever mod you want to get the last word is closer to the end of the load order.

Changelog:

1.0.0

Added Puma assault tank (With lore-appropriate + weapons. Scariest vehicle in the mod probably).
Added Rhino assault class fire support tank.
Added Ontos (LRM)
Added two version of Von Luckner heavy tank.

Dynamic Lances rebalanced to account for increased vehicle lethality, heavier vehicles appear 0.5-1 skull later than before.
Implemented MechResizer to scale the new vehicles properly.

Added Heavy Vehicle Flamer (Contributed by LadyAlecto)
Replaced most vanilla vehicle flamers with the new one. (Happy looting)
All Convoys now contain one tank instead of being all APCs.
Introduced custom unit_hover tag to get more control over when fast units spawn.
Gave all VIP and vanilla vehicles lance role tags.
Added lance defs for Mixed Diff 3.
High difficulty Assassination targets will now sometimes have light hovertank buddies instead of a light mech.

Pathingdef change: tracked vehicles now move as easily backward as forward.
Buffed the generic pilot used in friendly convoy vehicles.
Buffed fallback pilots used if spawner derps. (Something of a general fix)
Removed "Heavy" tag from Turhan APC (Too fragile to spawn in late-game escort missions).
Corrected Striker's structure values.
Corrected Zyphyr armor and redesignated "Zephyr (SRM2)"
Boosted Pegasus sensor range as a standin for BAP.
Gave Patton and Rommel the Defiance brand cannons specified in their fluff.
Gave Scimitar (LRM) a + weapon because it's BV is half what's normal for that bracket.
Vehicle evasion result 0.8 to 0.85 because of minor rounding issue.
    
This version number breaks my conventional incrementation method, but we're going to have a version that's exactly 1.0 darn it.

0.8.5

Gave Vanilla LRM/SRM Carriers a 'turret' hit location with stats.
    This sidesteps a vanilla bug that causes damage to occasionally be ignored becaue it can roll to hit the non existant turret.
    It was becoming more of a problem as I adjusted hit probabilities and turret hits became more common.
    "Roof" Armor is set to 80% of side armor.
    Note that while this makes total armor go up they aren't tougher.
    It makes it possible for hits that in vanilla would do nothing to cause damage.
Reversed a previous change and gave roofs/turrets to all my Carriers, Hunters and Saladins.
    
Added Patton and Rommel, a pair of relatively swift heavy tanks.
Added Scimitar variant (LRM15)
Added Pegasus variant (trades Mlaser for SRM6)

0.7.9hf

Squashed bug that caused Ontos to have no turret armor.
Changed Ontos model from Demolisher to Carrier.

Version 0.7.9

*Tried to make vehicles even more cautious.
*Vehicle armor multiplier 0.75 -> 0.8,
*Made vehicles inherently 10% harder to hit; reason they are low slung and can go hull down.
*Vehicles now get 20% fewer Evasion pips from movement to compensate because they are not as agile as mechs.
*Spawning Balance changes:
	Tagged Bulldogs as "Medium" vehicles instead of heavy.
	Tagged Hunter B as "Medium" instead of light because they were murdering my light mechs in testing.
	Tagged Demolisher-D as "Heavy" because it's fragile.
	Added "Assault" tag to Brutus-B.
	Added "Heavy" tag to Myrmidon
    Cloned the vanilla Manticore to make it spawn more often.
*Corrected Shrek-AC armor and MG mount locations.
*Removed "Turret" hit location from vehicles that shouldn't have one: Saladin, Hunter
*Removed all individual movedefs, replaced with generic ones for the handful of different speed categories.
*Gave minor equipment upgrades to a few units that are noticably weaker relative to category:
	Ignis (Both), Vedette (Both), Saladin (most fragile one), Po Heavy Tank.
*Gave Pike the advanced fire control system the fluff says it's supposed to have.
*Changed Marsden model from scorpion to bulldog.
*Changed Myrmidon model from scorption to manticore.
