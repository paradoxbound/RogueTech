# War Mechanics

## Starting or joining a war
- Factions have a chance each month to start or join a war. 
- This chanced is based on their current war exhaustion. 
- The more exhaustion they have the less likely they start or join a war.
- If they decide to enter war state they pick a random faction that is neighbouring them.
- If this faction is already in a war they join on the opponent side.
- If this faction is not at war yet they start a new war.

## Ending a war
- Factions have a chance each month to leave a war.
- This chanced is based on their current war exhaustion. 
- The more exhaustion they have the more likely they leave a war.
- If all faction on one side left the war, it ends.

## Resources
- Each month Factions get rewarded offensive and defensive resources based on the tags of the planets they hold.

Offence:
- planet_industry_poor = -1
- planet_industry_mining = 1
- planet_industry_rich = 2
- planet_industry_manufacturing = 3
- planet_industry_research = 4
- planet_other_starleague = 5

Defence:
- planet_pop_none = -1
- planet_pop_small = 1
- planet_pop_medium = 2
- planet_industry_aquaculture = 3
- planet_industry_agriculture = 3
- planet_pop_large = 4
- planet_other_hub = 5
- planet_other_megacity = 6
- planet_other_capital = 7

## Attacking a planet
- Each day Factions start an attack on one or more planets they see as valuable.
- A valuable planet is determined by the resources it has + how many own planets border him.
- Both factions take up to 100 resources from their regarding pool(offence or defence) and make a random roll on that.
- If the attacker wins he shifts the control percentage by the number he rolled higher then the defender.
- If a player does a mission for a faction on a planet he shifts the control by the percentgae set in the settings for that faction.
- Factions that like the player will offer priority missions going to the current important planets.

## Switching owner
- When a faction has more control over a planet then its current owner and also more then the percentage set in the settings the planet will flip over to that faction.
- When a planet is taken, that Faction recovers some exhaustion.

## Difficulty
- Planets on the border have a higher difficulty then the ones inland
- Only border systems send you against another faction, inland contracts only let you deal with lcoals and pirates.
